# Recommendation-Engine

## Introduction
This repo contains my first hands-on experience in developing a Recommendation engine using IBM Watson Studio dataset. The goal is to recommend the articles to the user using varius types of Recommendation engines that I studied while pursuing my Data Science Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Contents
- I.   Exploratory Data Analysis
- II.  Rank Based Recommendations
- III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
- IV.  Matrix Factorization
- V.   Extras & Concluding

## Description of Files
- I. Recommendation Engine - Contains the Python notebook of the whole project
- II. data - Contains two CSV files:
           - `articles_community.csv` - contains 1056 rows and 5 columns namely doc_body, doc_description, doc_full_name, doc_status, and article_id.
           - `user_item_interactions.csv` - contains 45,993 rows and 3 columns namely article ids, title, and email. Basically, gives info about which user is interacting with                                                 which article
